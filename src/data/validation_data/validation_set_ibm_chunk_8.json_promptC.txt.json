The instruction should specify which API endpoint and HTTP method to use for removing the action, along with an example request body and any required parameters. So, an improved response could be: To remove an instance group manager action using the Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud API, send a `DELETE` request to the following endpoint: `https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{projectId}/global/instanceGroupManagers/{instanceGroupManager}`. In the request body, include an empty object: `{}`. The API response will contain the details of the deleted instance group manager action."
