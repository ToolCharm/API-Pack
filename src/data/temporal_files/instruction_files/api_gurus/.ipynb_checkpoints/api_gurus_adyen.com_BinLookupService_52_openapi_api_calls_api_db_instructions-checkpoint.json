This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Check if 3D Secure is available\nDescription: Verifies whether 3D Secure is available for the specified BIN or card brand.

The response to this call contains the amount of the interchange and scheme fees charged by the network for this transaction, and also which surcharging policy is possible (based on current regulations).\n\n> Since not all information is known in advance (for example, if the cardholder will successfully authenticate via 3D Secure or if you also plan to provide additional Level 2/3 data), the returned amounts are based on a set of assumption criteria you define in the `assumptions` parameter.\nEndpoint: post-getCostEstimate\nAPI: Adyen BinLookup API\n###Output:\nI need to know how to get a fees cost estimate with the Adyen BinLookup API.\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Check if 3D Secure is available\nDescription: Verifies whether 3D Secure is available for the specified BIN or card brand.

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

The API's response includes the interchange and scheme fees charged by the network, along with the applicable surcharging policy based on current regulations. To define my assumption criteria, I will provide specific details such as the card brand, transaction amount, and payment method in the `assumptions` parameter. This way, I can obtain an accurate and reliable cost estimate, allowing me to optimize my pricing strategy and enhance my business operations.\""

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",

This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```## Going live\n\nTo authneticate to the live endpoints, you need an [API credential](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials) from your live Customer Area.\n\nThe live endpoint URLs contain a prefix which is unique to your company account:\n```\n\nhttps://{PREFIX}-pal-live.adyenpayments.com/pal/servlet/BinLookup/v52/get3dsAvailability\n```\n\nGet your `{PREFIX}` from your live Customer Area under **Developers** > **API URLs** > **Prefix**.",
