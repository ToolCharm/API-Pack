For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL.

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",

The Disputes API lets you retrieve defense reasons, supply and delete defense documents, and accept or defend disputes.\n\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Disputes API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nDisputes API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/services/DisputeService/v30/defendDispute\n```",
