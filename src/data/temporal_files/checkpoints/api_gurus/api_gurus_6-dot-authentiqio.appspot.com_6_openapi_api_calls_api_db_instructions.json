Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API.

When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: authority updates a JWT with its signature\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: sign_update\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you kindly provide an illustrative example of how to implement the Authentiq API's 'sign_update' functionality to update a JWT with its signature?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.\n\nv4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; \n\nv5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes\nand PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`\n\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: key_bind\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you provide an illustration of how to utilize the Authentiq API's key_bind endpoint for updating an Authentiq ID, incorporating v4 JWT with email and phone hashes, as well as v5's POST request with email & phone scopes and a PUT request for registration JWT update?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.\n\nv4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; \n\nv5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes\nand PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`\n\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: key_bind\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you please assist me in updating my Authentiq ID using the Authentiq API?

When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: authority updates a JWT with its signature\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: sign_update\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you kindly provide an illustrative example of how to implement the Authentiq API's 'sign_update' functionality to update a JWT with its signature?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.\n\nv4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; \n\nv5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes\nand PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`\n\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: key_bind\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you provide an illustration of how to utilize the Authentiq API's key_bind endpoint for updating an Authentiq ID, incorporating v4 JWT with email and phone hashes, as well as v5's POST request with email & phone scopes and a PUT request for registration JWT update?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.\n\nv4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; \n\nv5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes\nand PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`\n\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: key_bind\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you please assist me in updating my Authentiq ID using the Authentiq API?

When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: authority updates a JWT with its signature\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: sign_update\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you kindly provide an illustrative example of how to implement the Authentiq API's 'sign_update' functionality to update a JWT with its signature?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.\n\nv4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; \n\nv5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes\nand PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`\n\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: key_bind\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you provide an illustration of how to utilize the Authentiq API's key_bind endpoint for updating an Authentiq ID, incorporating v4 JWT with email and phone hashes, as well as v5's POST request with email & phone scopes and a PUT request for registration JWT update?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: \nDescription: Update Authentiq ID by replacing the object.\n\nv4: `JWT(sub,email,phone)` to bind email/phone hash; \n\nv5: POST issuer-signed email & phone scopes\nand PUT to update registration `JWT(sub, pk, devtoken, ...)`\n\nSee: https://github.com/skion/authentiq/wiki/JWT-Examples\n\nEndpoint: key_bind\nAPI: Authentiq API\n###Output:\nCould you please assist me in updating my Authentiq ID using the Authentiq API?
