When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Updates a key\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nPlease show me how to update a key with the API V1.\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Creates a Integration Rule\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nHey, tell me how to create a integration rule with the API V1.\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Creates a namespace\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nI need to know how to create a namespace with the API V1.\n\nRemember, the goal is to demonstrate how a user would benefit from this specific API in a realistic scenario, using precise and clear language.

When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Updates a key\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nPlease show me how to update a key with the API V1.\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Creates a Integration Rule\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nHey, tell me how to create a integration rule with the API V1.\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Creates a namespace\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nI need to know how to create a namespace with the API V1.\n\nRemember, the goal is to demonstrate how a user would benefit from this specific API in a realistic scenario, using precise and clear language.

Your query should be designed in a way that makes the best use of this API's unique capabilities. When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Updates a key\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nPlease show me how to update a key with the API V1.\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Creates a Integration Rule\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nHey, tell me how to create a integration rule with the API V1.\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Creates a namespace\nDescription: \nEndpoint: \nAPI: API V1\n###Output:\nI need to know how to create a namespace with the API V1.\n\nRemember, the goal is to demonstrate how a user would benefit from this specific API in a realistic scenario, using precise and clear language.
