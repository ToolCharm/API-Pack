When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API. Think about typical scenarios or problems that the API is designed to solve and formulate your query accordingly.\n\nExamples for practice:\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Get all items for inside a Vault\nDescription: \nEndpoint: GetVaultItems\nAPI: 1Password Connect\n###Output:\nCould you please provide an illustrative example of how to retrieve all items from a specific vault using the 1Password Connect API?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Delete an Item\nDescription: \nEndpoint: DeleteVaultItem\nAPI: 1Password Connect\n###Output:\nHow do I remove an item using the 1Password Connect API?\n\n###Input:\nFunctionality: Get all items for inside a Vault\nDescription: \nEndpoint: GetVaultItems\nAPI: 1Password Connect\n###Output:\nCould you please help me retrieve all items stored within a vault using 1Password Connect?\n\nRemember, the goal is to demonstrate how a user would benefit from this specific API in a realistic scenario, using precise and clear language.

When crafting your query, focus on:\n\n1. **API Name Integration:** Clearly include the API's name in your query to ensure relevance.\n2. **Specificity:** Replace broad or vague terms with precise, concrete details relevant to the API's purpose.\n3. **Conciseness:** Keep your query as brief as possible while still fully conveying the needed information. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.\n4. **Excluding API Endpoint:** Do not include the API's endpoint in your query; focus only on the user's need and how the API fulfills it.\n\nCreate a query that a user might realistically use when interacting with the given API.
